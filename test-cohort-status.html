    <h1>Cohort Status Implementation Test</h1>
    
    <h2>What was implemented:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>✅ Added dynamic cohort status loading to ambassadors page</li>
        <li>✅ Created public API endpoint: /api/public/cohorts/active</li>
        <li>✅ Dynamic CTA section that changes based on cohort status:
            <ul>
                <li>Applications Open: Shows "Apply Now" button with perks list and deadline countdown</li>
                <li>Applications Closed: Shows notification signup for next cohort</li>
                <li>Program Ongoing: Shows notification signup for next year's cohort</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>✅ Added application modal for when applications are open</li>
        <li>✅ Perks display when applications are open</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Current Active Cohort Data:</h2>
    <pre>
    {
        "year": "2024",
        "active": true,
        "startDate": "2024-09-01",
        "endDate": "2025-06-30",
        "maxAmbassadors": 20,
        "applicationDeadline": "2024-08-15",
        "perks": [
            "Leadership training",
            "Networking events",
            "Certificate of achievement",
            "Priority access to career events"
        ],
        "requiredTrainings": [
            "Orientation",
            "Leadership basics",
            "EMSI values and culture"
        ]
    }
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Expected Behavior:</h2>
    <p>Since the application deadline (2024-08-15) is in the past and we're currently in the program period (2024-09-01 to 2025-06-30), the ambassadors page should show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Ready to Become an Ambassador?"</li>
        <li>"Applications for the 2025 cohort will open soon. Follow us to stay updated!"</li>
        <li>"Get Notified" button</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>To Test Different Scenarios:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In admin dashboard, go to "Manage Cohorts"</li>
        <li>Edit the 2024 cohort and change the application deadline to a future date</li>
        <li>Refresh the ambassadors page - it should show "Applications Are Open" with perks</li>
        <li>Change the application deadline to past but start date to future</li>
        <li>Refresh - it should show "Applications Closed" with program start date</li>
    </ol>
