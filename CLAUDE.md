# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a career center web application for EMSI Marrakech, providing students and alumni with job opportunities, events, and career resources. The project is a static website with Express.js backend for authentication and basic admin functionality.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Static HTML pages with CSS styling and vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Express.js server with JWT authentication
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel with static file serving
- **Authentication**: Simple admin login system with bcrypt password hashing

### Key Files Structure
- `index.html` - Main landing page with hero section and stats
- `jobs.html` - Job listings with search and filter functionality  
- `events.html` - Career events with registration modals
- `about.html` - Information about the career center
- `admin-login.html` - Admin authentication page
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Protected admin dashboard
- `server.js` - Express backend with authentication routes
- `public/main.js` - Frontend JavaScript functionality
- `public/style.css` - Complete styling system

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
npm install
```
Install all required dependencies (express, body-parser, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken).

### Running the Application
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
# or 
node server.js
```
The server runs on port 3000 by default (or PORT environment variable).

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
Verify server is running and get uptime information.

### Testing
No test framework is currently configured. The package.json shows a placeholder test command.

## Key Features

### Frontend Functionality
- **Navigation**: Pill-shaped bottom navigation bar with active states
- **Job Search**: Advanced filtering by keyword, location, and job type
- **Event Registration**: Modal-based registration system with form validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern CSS animations
- **Performance**: Intersection Observer for animations, lazy loading for images

### Backend Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login system with rate limiting and security headers
- **Protected Routes**: Enhanced middleware for securing admin endpoints with proper error handling
- **User Management**: Simple in-memory user storage (production should use database)
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, CORS configuration, and graceful shutdown handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoint and performance monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling and proper logging

### Admin Credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` (hashed in code)

## Styling System

The project uses a comprehensive CSS system with:
- **Color Scheme**: EMSI brand colors (blue #004A99, green #00A651)
- **Modern Design**: Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints at 992px and 576px
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated animations, optimized transitions, CSS containment for better rendering
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper focus management and color contrast
- **Optimization**: Reduced !important declarations, consolidated utility classes, optimized animations

## JavaScript Architecture

### Core Functionality (`public/main.js`)
- **Navigation Management**: Active state handling for pill navbar with collision prevention
- **Search & Filtering**: Debounced search with real-time filtering and performance optimization
- **Modal System**: Registration modals with proper accessibility and form validation
- **Animation System**: Intersection Observer for scroll animations with GPU acceleration
- **Performance Optimizations**: RequestAnimationFrame, lazy loading, and efficient event handling
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate functions, consolidated functionality, and improved error handling

### Event Handling
- Form validation with visual feedback and accessibility compliance
- Dynamic major selection based on year of study
- Job saving functionality with localStorage and state management
- Responsive navbar with scroll hide/show behavior
- Notification system for user feedback
- Performance monitoring and error tracking

## Development Notes

- The application currently uses in-memory storage for users (enhanced with rate limiting and security)
- For production deployment, implement proper database integration
- JWT secret key should be moved to environment variables (currently has fallback)
- Image optimization and CDN integration recommended for production
- Error handling and logging have been implemented
- All dependencies are properly configured in package.json
- Accessibility features have been implemented to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
